# Slide 15 game created with Python Turtle

By clicking puzzle_game.py, a turtle window is brought up and it renders the game UI.

The player can enter the user name and specify the maximum moves for the current game.

The user can click the reset button to restart the game; click the exit button or close the window to exit; click the load button to load a new group of tiles for another game.

Game resources can be edited in `Images` folder, where each folder inside is a new game.

*This project was finished in Fall 2022.
